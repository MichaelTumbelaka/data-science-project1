This matrix is a table that shows how accurate our predictions were across various classes, using shades of blue where lighter tones indicate higher accuracy.

When the classifier indicates heart disease, it encourages individuals to consider changes in their lifestyle habits. For example, they might choose to eat healthier foods or exercise more often, as suggested by recent studies (Gunjan, 2023), aiming to lower their cholesterol and blood pressure levels and reduce their risk of developing heart disease. These classifications raise awareness about heart disease risks and remind individuals to make better decisions that can contribute to a longer and healthier life."
